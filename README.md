# cic2020interns_wk5 - PoC Sprint 1

## Scenario
Throughout the year, IBM CIC Baton Rouge conducts career fairs where candidates and employers are provided a chance to meet one another, establish professional relationships, and discuss potential job and/or internship opportunities. Normally, the center uses a custom app which manages the recruitment process but due to COVID-19, the center has pulled back from in-person interviewing, amid mushrooming infections worldwide, and is resorting to virtual events. You are tasked with developing a solution that incorporates the use of breakout sessions in Webex with the existing recruitment app.

This effort uses 3 Agile teams of full stack app devs. Scrum Team 1 is responsible for the Candidates API and Team 2, the Breakout Rooms API. **You are on Scrum Team 3 which owns the Queue Manager API.**
